        "# 1. Creating Text Features - ngrams\n",
        "\n",
        "N-grams in Creating Text Features\n",
        "\n",
        "N-grams are contiguous sequences of n items from a given sequence of text or speech. In the context of text features, these items are typically words (but can also be characters or phonemes). N-grams capture the co-occurrence of words in a text and can provide more contextual information than individual words alone (as in a simple Bag of Words model).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of different types of n-grams:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Uni-grams (n=1): These are single words. A Bag of Words model essentially uses uni-grams.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: For the sentence \"The quick brown fox\", the uni-grams are: \"The\", \"quick\", \"brown\", \"fox\".\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Bi-grams (n=2): These are sequences of two adjacent words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: For the sentence \"The quick brown fox\", the bi-grams are: \"The quick\", \"quick brown\", \"brown fox\".\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Tri-grams (n=3): These are sequences of three adjacent words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: For the sentence \"The quick brown fox\", the tri-grams are: \"The quick brown\", \"quick brown fox\".\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Quad-grams (n=4): These are sequences of four adjacent words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: For the sentence \"The quick brown fox\", the quad-grams are: \"The quick brown fox\".\n",
        "\n",
        "And so on for higher values of n.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Use N-grams for Text Features?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Capture Context: Unlike uni-grams, n-grams (with n > 1) retain some information about the order of words and the context in which they appear. This can be crucial for understanding the meaning and sentiment of a text. For example, the bi-gram \"not good\" has a very different sentiment than the uni-grams \"not\" and \"good\" considered separately.\n",
        "2. Improve Model Performance: By incorporating n-grams, machine learning models can learn more complex relationships in the text and often achieve better performance in tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and language modeling.\n",
        "3. Handle Negation: Bi-grams like \"not happy\" can help models understand negation, which is often missed by simple uni-gram models.\n",
        "4.  Common Phrases: N-grams can capture common phrases or idioms that have a specific meaning when the words appear together (e.g., \"piece of cake\").\n",
        "\n",
        "How N-grams are Used in Feature Creation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Tokenization: The text is first broken down into individual words (tokens).\n",
        "2. N-gram Generation: Based on the desired value of n, all possible contiguous sequences of n tokens are generated from each document in the corpus.\n",
        "3. Vocabulary Creation: A vocabulary of all unique n-grams across the entire corpus is created.\n",
        "4. Feature Vector Creation: Each document is then represented by a vector where each dimension corresponds to an n-gram in the vocabulary. The value in each dimension can be:\n",
        "\n",
        "The frequency of that n-gram in the document (similar to Bag of Words but for n-grams).\n",
        "\n",
        "The presence or absence of that n-gram in the document (binary representation).\n",
        "TF-IDF weight of the n-gram.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of Bi-gram Feature Vectors:\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the sentences:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentence 1: \"The food is very good.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentence 2: \"The service is not good.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Bi-grams:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentence 1: \"The food\", \"food is\", \"is very\", \"very good\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentence 2: \"The service\", \"service is\", \"is not\", \"not good\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Vocabulary of Bi-grams:\n",
        "\n",
        "{\"The food\", \"food is\", \"is very\", \"very good\", \"The service\", \"service is\", \"is not\", \"not good\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "Bi-gram Frequency Vectors:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentence 1: {\"The food\": 1, \"food is\": 1, \"is very\": 1, \"very good\": 1, \"The service\": 0, \"service is\": 0, \"is not\": 0, \"not good\": 0}\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentence 2: {\"The food\": 0, \"food is\": 0, \"is very\": 0, \"very good\": 0, \"The service\": 1, \"service is\": 1, \"is not\": 1, \"not good\": 1}\n",
        "\n",
        "Considerations when using N-grams:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Increased Vocabulary Size: As n increases, the number of possible n-grams can grow exponentially, leading to a very large vocabulary and high-dimensional feature vectors. This can increase computational cost and potentially lead to data sparsity.\n",
        "2. Need for Sufficient Data: To effectively learn patterns from higher-order n-grams (like tri-grams or quad-grams), you typically need a larger dataset.\n",
        "Feature Selection/Reduction: Due to the potential for a large number of n-grams, feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques might be necessary to focus on the most informative n-grams.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, n-grams are sequences of n consecutive words that can capture more contextual information than individual words. By using uni-grams, bi-grams, tri-grams, and higher-order n-grams as features, machine learning models can better understand the relationships between words in a text and improve performance on various NLP tasks."
